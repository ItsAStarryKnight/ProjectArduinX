# Project ArduinX
:wave: Hi, welcome to my project  
Project ArduinX is the "Controller of the future" (or maybe not :satisfied:)

- Takes inputs from Arduino and outputs them as keyboard/controller inputs
- More cost effective (actually probably not)
- DIY capabilities

PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT, ANY/ALL CODE HERE WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY UNLESS YOU HAVE THE PROPER HARDWARE AND PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENTS SET UP

# TODO:
- Add more stuff to README
- Implement a GUI for binding inputs
- ADD MORE BUTTONS!!
